Map.Entry interface in Java provides certain methods to access the entry in the Map.
By gaining access to the entry of the Map we can easily manipulate them

        Interface Map.Entry
        k -> Key
        V -> Value

        If we need to iterator a map we need to go with Convert it into SET<Map.Entry> entryset
        Set<Map.Entry> entrySet() â€“ Returns the Set view of the entire map.

        Note : This is not a method of Map.entry interface but it is discussed here because this method is useful while working with Map.Entry interface.

        entrySet()

        The java.util.HashMap.entrySet() method in Java is used to create a set out of the same elements contained in the hash map. It basically returns a set view of the hash map or we can create a new set and store the map elements into them.

Example
        HashMap <String,Integer> mapp = new HashMap<String,Integer>();

        Set<Map.Entry<String,Integer> name = map.geyEntry();
